# Engineering Studio — design notes, decoupling & verification status

Read this (with `README.md` + `INTEGRATION.md`) **before editing** the studio.

## The decoupling contract (why doc/screenshots/tests need no runtime)

Three seams keep the runtime out of everything that must be validated offline:

1. **Pure domain** — `@visuelconcept/wui-eng-core` imports **nothing** from
   `@wincc-oa/*` / `winccoa-manager`. All engineering logic (diff, plan, config
   builders, SimaticML parse, offsets, naming) is plain TypeScript, unit-tested
   with vitest in `node` (no DOM, no OA). The only runtime touch-point is the
   `EngPort` interface — the applier calls it; tests pass an in-memory fake.
2. **Page depends on `lit` only** — `wui-eng-studio` does **not** import any
   `@wincc-oa/*` package. It themes through `--theme-*` custom properties **with
   dark fallbacks** (`eng-theme.ts`), so it renders inside the shell AND
   standalone. All I/O goes through the injected **`EngGateway`**.
3. **Two gateways** — `HttpEngGateway` (`/api/eng`) for the shell;
   `DemoEngGateway` (in-memory, seeded by `demo-data.ts`) for docs, screenshots
   and the offline demo. The screenshot tool drives the demo build via
   `vite preview` + preinstalled Chromium — no login, no WebSocket, no backend.

Consequence: `npm test` (core) and `node tools/screenshot-eng-studio.mjs`
(page) both run in CI with **no WinCC OA**.

## Check-in / check-out semantics

- The **workspace** is the working copy (types + DPs + configs) plus a
  `baseline` = the fingerprint of each object at check-out time.
- **diff** (`diff.ts`) → `EngPlan`: workspace-only ⇒ *create*; both-but-different
  ⇒ *update*; **live-only AND in the baseline** (the user removed a checked-out
  object) ⇒ *delete*. A live object that was never checked out is **never**
  deleted implicitly (the PARA lesson). If the live object drifted from its
  baseline ⇒ the item is flagged **conflict**.
- **apply** (`apply.ts`) refuses conflicting items (reports `skipped`), is
  idempotent (create of an existing object ⇒ `skipped`, not an error), and writes
  each config family with the **atomic builders** (one `dpSetWait` each).
- `EngPlan` is the *single* serializable object: it is both the dry-run preview
  and the check-in request body — what you preview is what gets applied.

## Address books (the iba idea), and the S7 access-mode duality

Each device carries a persistent **AddressBook**; entries hold **candidate
addresses per access mode**. For S7 this is deliberate: a **standard**
(non-optimized) DB member has both a classic operand (`s7`: `DB12.DBD4`) and a
symbolic path (`s7plus`/`opcua`); an **optimized** DB member has only symbolic
candidates. The device declares which modes it offers; the config generation
picks the candidate matching the device's mode.

## SimaticML parser + offsets — verified vs PENDING

- The parser (`simaticml/parse.ts`) + the dependency-free XML reader
  (`simaticml/xml.ts`) turn TIA Openness `Export()` of global DBs and UDTs into
  book entries (UDT expansion, comments, arrays skipped with warnings).
- Standard-block **offset computation** (`simaticml/offsets.ts`) implements the
  classic S7 layout (BOOL bit-packing, word alignment, `String[n]` = n+2, struct
  padding) and is unit-tested.
- ⚠️ **Calibration PENDING on real exports.** The fixtures
  (`wui-eng-core/src/samples/simaticml-fixtures.ts`) are hand-authored against
  the SimaticML v5 dialect. Before production the parser must be re-checked
  against **real** `PlcBlock.Export()` / `PlcType.Export()` files (see
  INTEGRATION "inputs needed"), and the standard-DB offsets cross-checked against
  a live DB. The S7 `_datatype` **transformation codes are intentionally left at
  a sentinel (0)** in `drivers/s7.ts` until verified against the S7 driver —
  same "verify against the real system, not training data" culture as
  `docs/wui-para/NOTES.md` (the DPL `-filter` work).

## What is proven

- OPC UA address mapping (`drivers/opcua.ts`) is the **verified** tag-importer
  code, unchanged (reference `<Conn>$$1$1$<NodeId>`, datatypes 750–768,
  directions). The `_address`/`_distrib` write set generalises the proven
  `tagImporterController.writeAddress`; the `_alert_hdl` and `_archive` writes
  mirror `para-alarm.ts` / `para-archive.ts`.

## Staged for later (explicit)

- **Backend** (`engController.ts`): `checkin`/`test-read` wired; **config
  read-back** in `readSnapshot` and the driver/poll-group resolution in
  `resolveAddressContext` are TODO. The studio runs fully on the demo gateway
  meanwhile.
- **TIA Openness connector**: a separate study (`docs/wui-tia-connector/`, to be
  written) — a thin agent that runs `PlcBlock.Export()`/`PlcType.Export()` and
  drops the XML bundle to the studio's ingestion (watched folder + POST), so the
  studio parses it as a book. Goal: minimal human steps between TIA and WinCC OA.
- Devices/workspace **server-side store**, mass-edit rules & config profiles,
  auto-map-by-name, multi-user check-out locking.
